When you’re busy prototyping an app, it’s helpful to be able to see at a glance what images still need to be filled and what size they are. Placeholder does exactly that: it’s a `UIImageView` subclass that automatically renders its size along with any title you want.

To install, just drag Placeholder.swift into your Xcode project, then change the class of any placeholder image views to be `Placeholder` rather than `UIImageView`. When the final artwork arrives, all you need to do is change the class back to `UIImageView` and you’re back to normal – easy!

**Note:** Xcode 9.2 and earlier overlay the words “UIImageView” on all `UIImageView` subclasses, but this only occurs at design time. This bug is fixed in Xcode 9.3.


## Options

There are three properties for `Placeholder` images that you might want to customize, all of which are exposed to Interface Builder:

- `title` lets you add an optional string to be placed above the size, e.g. “User avatar”.
- `textColor` lets you adjust the text color used to render the title and size. Defaults to `.white`.
- `textFontSize` lets you adjust the text font size used to render the title and size. Defaults to `20`.
- `rounded` rounds the corners of the image view using the minimum of the width and height. This creates lozenges in rectangular views and circles in square views.
